# Nexus-Auto-Harvester
Auto-Harvester for Achaea's Nexus client.

This is an auto-harvester I put together. This was really my first full scipt/system I've ever done in Nexus/Javascript. So, please be gentle.

Along with being able to block the harvesting of herbs you define, it also keeps track of the rooms you've been to during that Achaean month and will not try to harvest anything from there.

Commands:

I do plan on expanding this to include Gathering and Extracting at some point.
