# Nexus-Auto-Harvester
Auto-Harvester for Achaea's Nexus client.

This is an auto-harvester I put together. This was really my first full scipt/system I've ever done in Nexus/Javascript. So, please be gentle.

Along with being able to block the harvesting of herbs you define, it also keeps track of the rooms you've been to during that Achaean month and will not try to harvest anything from there.

Commands:

harv --------------------------- Print this list

harvreset ---------------------- Reset the ENTIRE system back to default without logging out and back in

hblock [herb] ------------------ Add an herb to the block list to not harvest it

hublock [herb] ----------------- Unblock a blocked herb to return to harvesting it

hsblock ------------------------ Show the current block list.

aharv -------------------------- Toggle the auto-harvesting off and on


I do plan on expanding this to include Gathering and Extracting at some point.
